### Currently working as a researcher and participating in PhD programme

Motivated and responsible Data Analyst with significant experience in increasing comprehension of
reports, studies and presentations. Beside my studies at the University I took part actively in research and teaching projects. Thanks to lecturing statistical courses for years, I am confident in any conventional or innovative Data Analysis project, like standard econometrics or natural language processing. Also, I am very proud of my knowledge in R language.
